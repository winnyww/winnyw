        <h2>Thriving Green Power</h2>
        <p>This is a project of data visualization of fruit consumption in China
          and thoughts concerning globalization behind the thriving of avocado market.  </br>
        <br></br>

          “Though avocado only entered the Chinese market several years ago,
          its imports have been soaring…it eventually won the hearts of middle-class
          foodies as it is rich in nutrition”. The uprising of avocados in Chinese market has
          been a miracle. The demand of avocados by young middle-class has increased roughly 1000
          times more.
        <br></p>

        <p id="pic-1-text">Fruits are always a popular choice for gifts in China, and the trend of
          popular fruits tells us what Chinese consumers favor in a global market.
          <br></br>
          I embody this idea using the concept of data sculpture,
          which is “a direct externalization of the data” in three fruits:
          apple, strawberry and avocado.
         </p>

<div class="info-2">
  <p>From this visualization, my viewers will realize the demand of apple and strawberry are dropping over the
    years, even though the market for apple is still huge; the demand of avocade, however, boosts in a very short time
    that the shape looks very unnatural.
    <br></br>Viewers will get to think about the concept of “traditional”
    and “popular”, and they will also come to the awareness of a changing global market.
    <br></br>
    In the near future, how much will avocado, the green power thrives in Chinese market?
    Will more consumers follow this trend as avocade is often branded as “healthy food,” “best choice
    for a diet?” How to recognize the bandwagon effect behind this crazily growing market “colonialization”?
    <br>

  <p>I held an exhibition show for this project. I 3D printed three friut models, colored them and put them in
    a Chinese fruit gift basket. In the show, audiences got to read my motivation of creation and touched the "data"
    with their own hands.
