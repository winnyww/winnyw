        <h2>Hey! Where's your phone-prototype process</h2>
        <p>This is a project of wireless wearable fashion that expresses a message, in a fashion way. </br>
        <br></br>

        Almost everyone finds themselves spend a good amount of time looking for their phone. Every now and then, we will
        need a reminder for ourselves: hey! where is your phone? Drawing inspiration from such experiences, I decided to
        address this piece of repeated reminder in an artistic and playful way--to put it on a t-shirt. Phone is an inseparable
        part of life; the urgent need to keep our phones around all the time has already been the fashion of our time. So why not
        wear it on us?

  <p>However, the school was closed because of COVID-19 and I had no access to many resources,
    the process of applying thermoChromic ink to garment wasn’t easy.
    A better option would be screen printing, but my only option was to
    make a mode with cardboard and paint with brushes. So to some degree,
    the fabrication result wasn’t as satisfying but was the best I could do.
    <br><br>
    I will finish this product when I'm back in campus studio with the materials/tools I need.
